## Impact statement

We are on the cusp of Artificial Intelligence (AI) changing the way that digital environmental science is conducted. This will allow new cross disciplinary integration of observed data that will in turn enable new insights of the way environmental systems develop. This requires frictionless and standardised data delivery. This report describes outcomes from a workshop to plan for the development of standardised Application Programming Interface (API) to allow machine-readable data exchange across multiple environmental disciplines and to enable AI enhanced integration of these data.
